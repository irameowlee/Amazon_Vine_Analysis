## Module 16: Amazon Vine Analysis

###Overview : 
We are working with Jennifer on analyzing Amazon reviews. We will be working with a dataset that deals with pet product reviews. We used PySpark to perform ETL and also connected the data to AWS RDS instance and loaded the transformed data into pgAdmin.

###Results: 
* Number of reviews : 38010
* Number of Vine reviews: 170
* Number of non-vine reviews: 37840
* Number of 5 star vine reviews : 65
* Number of 5 star non-vine reviews : 20612
* perentage of vine reviews that were 5 stars : 57.4%
* percentage of non-Vine reviews that were 5 stars : 47.9%

##Summary:
Slight positive bias. Paid reviewers are ten percent more likely to give a 5 star review, compared to the non-vine reviewers.
